# embeddable-cors

This is a fork of [Tiago Quelhas's corsRequest](https://github.com/tjgq/cors-request) with features removed for use as an embedded CORs library. I wouldn't recommend using it. If you need a minimal cors lib, upstream will probably keep you more comfortable.

There is a minified version inside of the build directory for convenience.
